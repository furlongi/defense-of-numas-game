                Our ancestors discovered these saves North of us thousands of years ago. However, rock monsters started appearing and took over our resource supply.

                We used the caves to mine crystals filled with energy to supplement our daily lives, but living has become harder with such a short supply of the crystals.

                We used the crystals for many centuries to create technology. The towers you used in the tower defenses are an example of that.

                Our race of Numas have thrived with these technologies until the rock monsters appeared. Even with our advancements, their monstrous strength overpowered us.

                You have kept us safe from the monster attacks so far. We are all grateful for you.

                We no longer have a crystal shortage thanks to the crystals you recovered from the mines. Maybe this long battle will finally come to an end.
