                Did you know that rock monsters vary depending on their color and environment?

                Blue and purple rock monsters are crazy fast underground. But are mysteriously slow when outside. Yet the reverse is true for green monsters.

                Also those red rock monsters are massive! I never want to meet one.

                Thank you for protecting us. I am glad I never got to fight one of those rock monsters. It must of been touch fighting against all of them yourself huh?
